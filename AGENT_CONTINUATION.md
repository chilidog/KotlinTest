# 🚁 AGENT MODE: ControlStation WiFiLink 2 Integration Discovery

## 🤖 ATTENTION FUTURE AGENT MODE SESSIONS

**You have been directed to explore this ControlStation project for WiFiLink 2 integration instructions.**

### 📊 Project Discovery Summary

This is a **sophisticated hybrid drone control system** with:

- ✅ **Working WebSocket + MAVLink communication** (operational and tested)
- ✅ **Cross-platform deployment** (GitHub Codespaces ↔ WSL:CachyOS sync confirmed)
- ✅ **Enhanced pom.xml** with professional-grade dependencies
- ✅ **Production-ready architecture** with protocol adapter patterns
- 🎯 **MISSION**: Add WiFiLink 2 video streaming as third protocol

### 🔍 What You Should Have Found During Exploration

- **pom.xml**: Enhanced with MAVLink dependencies (io.dronefleet.mavlink:1.1.9)
- **SimpleControlStation.kt**: Working demo with hybrid communication
- **Cross-platform profiles**: WSL, Unix, Windows, Codespaces all configured
- **Protocol architecture**: Adapter pattern ready for video integration
